# Email signup analysis script
### Usage:
### Create a directory on your computer, preferably in a place where you can easily access it. Download or copy the contents of the scripts into a text editor and place it in the directory. Make sure you grab both the sfg_data_analysis.php script and hash.pl.
### Open the terminal application located in Applications->Utilities->Tterminal.app (MacOS). On Windows, right click on the Windows menu icon and select "Run...", then type "cmd" in the field and press OK.
### In the terminal type in the change directory command to get to the directory you created:
### >cd [name of directory] (Press enter)
### You can type in >pwd to be sure you are in the correct directory.
### Once you are in the directory run the following command (make sure you have the SailThru and SFG files in this directory also):
### >php sfg_data_analysis.php [Sailthru File] [SFG File] [email column number] [t (option for testing purposes)]
### After the script runs, the results should be in a file inside the final_files directory.
## Depends on hash.pl being in the same directory.
